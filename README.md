# Pose Estimation Play Ground
Will Release some of useful functions in my PhD research in object pose estimation.

1. SICP: Iterative closest point method with scaling parameters.
How to use:

1) Define the param.outer_number and param.inner_number

2) initialize the S0, based on my experience, [1 0; 0 1] is good to go.

3) if_visualization could be set to either 0 or 1 depnds on whether the user hope to visualize the progress of alignment.

4) model and data are 2 by N matrix.
